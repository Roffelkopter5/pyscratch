# PyScratch
Scratch-like programming but in Python.

With the help of this packages you can easily program simple games very similar to Scratch. You should have a bit of Python experience, because you'll have to manage certian things (like variables and/or arrays) yourself. The package uses pygame and its sprite system for rendering and displaying the game. It can be imported into any python file and used from there. An gui application is also planned, but currently not under development.

## Important note:
This package is highly inspired by Scratch but does not try to replicate exact scratch code nor will it be able to load scratch projects. If you're more interested in a _more detailed copy_ of Scratch, I can highly recommend [pystage](https://github.com/pystage/pystage "pystage on GitHub"). Also, this package is in the earliest stages of production and is therefore lacking a lot of functionality.
